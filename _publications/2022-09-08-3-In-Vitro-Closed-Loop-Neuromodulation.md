excerpt: 'This paper describes the development of an in-vitro system for electrically recording and stimulating large animal nerves. This is demonstrated experimentally using explanted pig ulnar nerves, which show evoked compound action potentials (eCAPs) when stimulated. These eCAPs were examined both in the time and velocity domain at a baseline temperature of 20° C, and at temperatures increasing up to those seen in-vivo (37°C). The results highlight that as the temperature is increased within the in-vitro system, faster conduction velocities (CVs) similar to those present in-vivo can be observed. To our knowledge, this is the first time an in-vitro peripheral nerve system has been validated against in-vivo data, which is crucial for promoting more widespread adoption of such systems for the optimisation of neural interfaces.'
