excerpt: 'Little research exists on extending ex-vivo systems to large animal nerves, and to the best of our knowledge, there has yet to be a study comparing these against in-vivo data. This paper details the first ex-vivo system for large animal peripheral nerves to be compared with in-vivo results. Detailed ex-vivo and in-vivo closed-loop neuromodulation experiments were conducted on pig ulnar nerves. Pig ulnar nerves were sustained ex-vivo up to 5 h post-explantation. CV distributions of ex-vivo and in-vivo data were compared, showing closer correspondence at 37 Â°C. Regression analysis results also demonstrated that modal CV and time since explantation were negatively correlated, whereas modal CV and temperature were positively correlated. The proposed ex-vivo system results were compared with those seen in-vivo, providing new insights into large animal nerve activity post-explantation. Such a system is crucial for complementing in-vivo experiments, maximising collected experimental data, and accelerating neural interface development.'
