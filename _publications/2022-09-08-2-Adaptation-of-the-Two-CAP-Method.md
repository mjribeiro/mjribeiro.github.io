excerpt: 'This work extends the Two-CAP method and demonstrates its application to bipolar in-vivo recordings made with multiple-electrode arrays. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using simulated data with ground truth to ascertain the stability and limits of the algorithm before experimental data was examined. The sensitivity analysis highlighted that recording distance shows a considerable impact on the performance of this extended Two-CAP method, as well as the velocity interval chosen when creating the model. The in-vivo data was also compared against an equivalent simulated model, and a relatively low mean squared error was obtained when comparing the two distributions.'
