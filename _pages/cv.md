Projects
======
* <b>PhD internship at The Technology Partnership (TTP)</b>, <i>Feb '22 -- Aug '22</i>

  Worked as a consultant as part of the neurotechnology team, contributing to both internal R\&D projects and client-facing projects. Developed [low-power ML algorithms for use in implantable cardiac devices](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mafalda-j-ribeiro_machinelearning-ttp-activity-6978670651268067328-iBKR?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), which have since been presented in prototypes at neurotechnology conferences and summits.

* <b>AI Challenge Project</b>, <i>Feb '20 -- May '20</i>

  As part of MRes year, researched and developed electronics and AI models for project on air quality monitoring device. Worked within an interdisciplinary team considering AI, engineering, and social science challenges for such a product.

* <b>MEng Research Project</b>, <i>Nov '18 -- May '19</i>

  Development of a microfluidic Brain-On-Chip platform for ultra-low noise electrical recordings.

* <b>Digital Design and Verification Placement (Intel)</b>, <i>Jul '16 -- Aug '17</i>

  Worked at Intel’s Communications and Devices Group for placement year, specifically on functional verification and Design-For-Test of application-specific ICs (ASICs). Contributed to various projects’ digital design and verification using VHDL and SystemVerilog. Also wrote and presented conference paper at Synopsys User Group Conference (SNUG)  titled "Automatic Test Point Insertion in MPHY Products" (Technical committee award, honourable mention).s

* <b>STEM Ambassador – Volunteer</b>, <i>Jul '16 -- Aug '17</i>

  Industrial mentor for local school’s Go4SET competition team. Organised several volunteering events with placement colleagues to promote STEM-related education and careers.
