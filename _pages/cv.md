Education
======
* PhD at Centre for Accountable, Responsible and Transparent AI (ART-AI) <i>2020 – 2024</i>
  * Interdisciplinary PhD project focused on the development of a closed-loop peripheral nerve interface which leverages AI techniques. This entails the development of an in vitro setup for collecting neuromodulation data from explanted nerves, and subsequently the development and assessment of AI models for effectively processing this data.
* Integrated MRes in Computer Science, University of Bath, <i>2019 - 2020</i>
	* Mark: Distinction
	* Modules in machine learning, statistics, robotics, and social science
* MEng in Electronic and Electrical Engineering (with Placement), University of Bath, <i>2014 - 2019</i>
