Profile
======
* Final year PhD student in machine learning (ML) and biomedical engineering
* 4.5 years of experience using Python, PyTorch, Docker, and Git for ML and data-driven research projects during PhD and in industry
* Industry experience across 1.5 years at The Technology Partnership (TTP) and Intel
* Seeking post-PhD role as AI/ML research scientist or engineer starting from July 2024
* Distinction in postgraduate MRes in AI. High 2:1 MEng (Hons) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the University of Bath, with a First Class in the MEng project component.

Experience
======
 * <b>University of Bath</b>, Doctoral Researcher, <i>Sept ’20 – Present</i>
   * Interdisciplinary PhD project on developing implantable closed-loop nerve interfaces to
improve treatment of various neurological conditions
   * Adapted and implemented CNN-based models such as VAE and U-Net (Noise2Noise)
models in PyTorch for efficient ML-based denoising of peripheral nerve data ([Paper](https://purehost.bath.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/311541808/EMBC2023.pdf) / [Code](https://github.com/mjribeiro/pns-ml-denoising))
   * Improved previous quadratic programming approach (Two-CAP method) for estimating
distributions of fibre conduction velocities in whole nerve electrical recordings ([Paper](https://purehost.bath.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/247985478/2CAP_EMBC_2022.pdf))
   * Recently expanded quadratic programming work with biophysically accurate simulation
models and ML-based segmentation of nerve imaging (histology) data (to be published)
   * Planned and carried out in-vivo and ex-vivo animal experiments to collect neuromodulation
datasets and promote data-driven and ML-based research ([Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016502702400061X))
   * Leveraged Docker to create reproducible and easy-to-use environments to reduce onboarding
time for collaborators
