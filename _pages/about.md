I am a PhD student at the Centre for Accountable, Responsible, and Transparent AI ([ART-AI](https://cdt-art-ai.ac.uk/)) at the University of Bath. I am particularly interested in leveraging AI for more efficient nerve interfaces 🧠⚡️

In my spare time I enjoy looking after my growing collection of houseplants, making the occasional painting 🌱
