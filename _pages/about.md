I am a PhD student at the Centre for Accountable, Responsible, and Transparent AI ([ART-AI](https://cdt-art-ai.ac.uk/)) at the University of Bath. I am particularly interested in leveraging AI/ML for more efficient nerve interfaces 🧠⚡️ More specifically, my research focuses on the development of ML and optimization techniques for efficiently denoising and decoding peripheral nerve data, and with the overall aim of developing more efficient and responsive implantable nerve interfaces.

In my spare time I enjoy learning new languages and making the occasional painting 🎨
