I am a final-year PhD student at the Centre for Accountable, Responsible, and Transparent AI ([ART-AI](https://cdt-art-ai.ac.uk/)) at the University of Bath. My research currently focuses on the development of ML and optimisation techniques for efficiently denoising and decoding peripheral nerve data, and with the overall aim of developing more efficient and responsive implantable nerve interfaces üß†‚ö°Ô∏è I have both PhD and industry experience in ML and software development in biomedical engineering more broadly.

I am currently seeking post-PhD opportunities that will allow me to use my interdisciplinary skill set in the development and application of AI/ML techniques to exciting and meaningful projects. If you're interested in discussing how my skills and experience can contribute to your team's goals, feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mafalda-j-ribeiro/). I'm excited to explore new opportunities that align with my passions and values!

In my spare time I enjoy learning new languages and making the occasional painting üé®
